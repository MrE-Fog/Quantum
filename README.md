# Quantum

This package allows variables to behave in a quantum mechanical way.

A quantum mechanical variable can be created in 2 ways:

1. Via `Quantum`'s initialiser directly.

   ```swift
   var quantumText = Quantum("Schr√∂dinger")
   ```

2. Via the `@Quantum` annotation.
   ```swift
   @Quantum
   var quantumNumber = 0
   ```

Variables governed by quantum mechanics behave differently from those governed by classical mechanics. For a classical mechanical system, it is possible to predict the present state if its past states and movements are known (determinism), and vice versa (reversibility). On the contrary, for a quantum mechanical system, it is impossible to predict its state at any point in time; its present state is unknown until observed.

```swift
quantumNumber = 1
quantumNumber = 2
quantumNumber = 3

print($quantumNumber.outcomeProbability)
//	Prints "[0: 0.125, 1: 0.125, 2: 0.25, 3: 0.5]".

print(quantumNumber)
//	Prints "0", "1", "2", or "3".
//	All for values are possible.
```
